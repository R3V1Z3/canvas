Visual programming can be more time-consuming given a mouse-based interface but it's an extremely helpful paradigm because of the error checking. It mostly ensures code is error-free by it's design.

So how about we focus on a standard text based interface that parses code and creates visual diagrams on-the-fly?

The diagrams/code can be operated on simultaneously, affecting the other.

One key difference with this javascript project will be that it focuses on immediate use, it will provide tons of shortcuts to automate certain tasks.

- Need to convert a database from one format to another? It will provide a series of models as well as means to easily model data in a way that makes conversion dead simple. CSV > JSON > SQL
- A web client wants an elegant signup form? Create the form with graphic HTML elements in the GUI, add CSS, and export it as an HTML/CSS/JS page or form.
- Have an idea for a WordPress plugin? Use a WP plugin template that asks for basic inputs and spits out quality plugin code.
- Creating a website theme? Just drag the visual HTML elements around and export it as a theme.
